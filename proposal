Data Project 1

Proposal: 
1. Project title: Comparing Restuarants Using APIs
2. Team members: Mark, Chander, Fernando, Jeanette
3. Project Description/Outline: We will be utilizing and comparing Yelp  and Google ratings to identify the top restaurants in various parts of Texas based on searches. 
4. Research Questions to answer: What are the top requested restaurants in Austin? 
What are their average ratings? Does the Vader sentiment match the yelp and google ratings? 
What could be some factors affecting this? Is it a good idea to start a business in these areas?  
What is the average, for example, Mexican restaurant rating in a specific zip code? 
We will pull average Mexican restaurant rating for each zip code, and then sort zip codes by the highest ratings to find the best restaurant in the area.
